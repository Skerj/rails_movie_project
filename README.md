## Description
This project will demonstrate the skills I have learned in rails!


This is a basic web app that allows you to insert movies and actors into a database and have them relate to each other. It then relays that information back to you in a readable format.

## Instructions
Fork and clone this repo.

Make sure to run ```bundle install```.

Run ```rake db:migrate``` to migrate the databases.
